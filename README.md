# Build An Alexa Widget

This Alexa sample skill is a template for a basic Alexa Widget.

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end.
The front end is the voice interface, or VUI.
The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model.
The back end is where the logic of your skill resides.

## Widget Architecture 
Each widget package consists of four parts 
datasources - where your data sources reside
documents - where your actual APL document for the widget resides
presentations - where your package definitions go in 
manifest.json - where your widget information would go. This information displays on the Widget gallery.
